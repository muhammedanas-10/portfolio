    <h3>BARCELONA</h3>
    <p>When i arrived barcelona,my dream was to play in the first team,
        <br>but i never could've imagined what would happen next! We visited
        <br>the city like tourists-barca's stadium is beautiful ,and i still
        <br>remember the emotion i felt the first time i stepped foot onto the 
        <br>Camp Nou.
        <br>
        As soon as i arrived in barcelona,i started training .i didn't sleep at
        <br>La Masia, but i went towent to Leon XII (an elementary school), where all the kids
        <br> from other cities where studying at. I spent every aternoon
        <br> with these kids, many of them from Barcelona and the rest from 
        <br>other Spanish provinces, like Iniesta. They also knew what it was like
        <br> to be far away fro from their families and a friends, so we had al a lot of
        <br> things in common. I had a hard time during the first two seasons.
        <br>I couldn't play for months because my immigration paperwork

            <h5>NATIONAL TEAM</h5>
            <p>
                I've always wanted to play for the national team and living far away <br> made that dream even stronger. I thought that it was going to be very hard,<br>
                that people in Argentina wouldn't know or recognize me. But one day,<br> when I was sixteen, I was called up to play in two friendlies with the U-20 team <br>
                against Paraguay and Uruguay- the beginning of my journey <br> We won the <br> U-20 World Cup in Netherlands
                one of the biggest achievements of my career.
